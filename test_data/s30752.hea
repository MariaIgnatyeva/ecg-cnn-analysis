#Age: 79  Sex: M
#Comments:
#  This is the same patient as s30751. During this recording
#  period there were a few minor ST depressions associated
#  with increased heart rate. Only one event reached criteria
#  for a significant episode, actually split into two episodes,
#  in lead 0, and another one in lead 2.
#Symptoms during Holter recording: None reported
#Diagnoses: 
#  Coronary artery disease
#Treatment:
#  Medications:
#    Atenolol
#    Simvastatin
#  Balloon Angioplasty: No data
#  Coronary Artery bypass Grafting: Triple bypass in 1994
#History: 
#  Angina, coronary heart disease
#  Hypertension: Yes
#  Left ventricular hypertrophy: No
#  Cardiomyopathy: No
#  Valve disease: No
#  Electrolyte abnormalities: No
#  Hypercapnia, anemia, hypotension, hyperventilation: No
#  Atrioventricular nodal conduction delay: No data
#  Intraventricular conduction block: Left anterior fascicular block
#  Previous Myocardial Infarction: No
#  Previous tests:
#    ECG stress test: Yes
#      Date: July, 1996
#      Findings: Abnormal - 2 mm anterior ST segment depressions
#    Thallium/Stress echo: Positive for inferior ischemia and wall motion abnormalities
#    Left ventricular function: 
#      Hypokinesis and dyskinesis of infero-apical and septal walls, ejection fraction 44%
#    Echocardiogram: 
#      Minimal left ventricular dysfunction & valvular regurgitation.
#    Coronary Arteriography:  
#      Distal occlusion of posterior descending coronary artery
#    Baseline ECG: 
#      Normal sinus rhythm, left anterior fascicular block, non-specific lateral ST-T abnormalities.
